Course Description
------------------

An introduction to the ethnographic study of politics, this course examines how anthropologists have understood politics to function in various social and economic systems: from small-scale societies to liberal democratic states. Starting with anthropological accounts of the politics of everyday life, we will examine what constitutes the political across several sites: electoral politics, public spheres, bureaucracies and humanitarian governance. Students are asked to read the assigned texts with attention to what is and is not understood to be political. Specifcally, they are asked to consider how questions of authority, coercion and violence have been theorized to relate to the question of politics, and how some aspects of social life have been regimented in explicitly non-political ways. What moral imaginaries are opened by the promise of politics, and how do they inform the practical governance of lives?

Course Objectives
-----------------

Upon taking this course, students will be able to:

*   identify the key anthropological debates about the role of “politics” in social life
*   differentiate between different kinds of political operations, from the everyday to the state
*   perform an anthropological analysis of political power in everyday life

The course will also help students develop close reading, critical thinking and academic writing skills.

Citations

Plagiarism is a serious offense. It's also wrong. If your text repeats part of another text verbatim, use quotation marks and include the source in parentheses (author's last name, year: page number). If your text paraphrases another, include the source from which you've borrowed ideas in parentheses (author's last name, year).
